Car Wheel Factory SWC Project

1. 4 Threads together in a Thread Pool

2. 1 Queue which uses Java Queue and is shared between all the Threads
   - Try to distribute the workload evenly
   - Consider alternatives to LinkedList
   - Emergency stops
   
3. 3 Types of Wheels
   - Primarily a time difference between types: 10, 14 and 17 Seconds and Name
   - Maybe use POJO for each type
  
4. Think over interfaces and use as much as possible

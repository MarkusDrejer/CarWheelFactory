Car Wheel Factory SWC Project

4 Threads together in a Thread Pool

1 Queue which uses Java Queue and is shared between all the Threads
   -Try to distribute the workload evenly
  
3 Types of Wheels
   -Primarily a time difference between types: 10, 14 and 17 Seconds
   -Maybe use POJO for each type
  
Think over interfaces and use as much as possible

Maybe add random chance of breakdown to simulate various problems with an actual assembly line

In presentation start with talking about group management and how well the work went
